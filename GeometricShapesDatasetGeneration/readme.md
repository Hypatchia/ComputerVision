# Task 1 : Generate a Rndom dataset (Dataset_1) that consists of Images of Geometric shapes where each image contains one shape only, fully visible.
    * Each Image contains one full primitive shape  'rectangle', 'triangle','ellipse'
    * Each shape is of a random color, position , orientation and size .
    * **Subtask1** : Primitive Geometric shapes Generation from scratch using Python and PyTorch.
    * **Subtask2** : Primitive Geometric Shapes Generation using OpenCV*
# Task 2 : Generate a dataset that consists of Images of Geometric shapes where each image contains multiple shapes defined by a size of items per image .
    * Each image contains a random number of shapes with random position, orientation and color
# Task 3 : Multiclass Classification of Images in Dataset 1 and Prediction of their classes using a CNN
    *
# Task 4 : Object detection using OpenCV for Dataset 2
